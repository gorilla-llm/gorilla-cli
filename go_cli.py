WELCOME_TEXT = """ü¶ç Welcome to Gorilla-CLI! Enhance your Command Line with the power of LLMs! 

Simply use `gorilla <your desired operation>` and Gorilla will do the rest. For instance:
    gorilla generate 100 random characters into a file called test.txt
    gorilla get the image ids of all pods running in all namespaces in kubernetes
    gorilla list all my GCP instances

A research prototype from UC Berkeley, Gorilla-CLI ensures user control and privacy:
 - Commands are executed only with explicit user approval.
 - While queries and error (stderr) logs are used to refine our model, we NEVER gather output (stdout) data.

Visit github.com/gorilla-llm/gorilla-cli for examples and to learn more!"""
